# Déjà View

This app is hosted at https://www.dejaview.cc/.

_Déjà View_ is a way to look at the events in your life from a birds' eye view.

This application is still under development, so some of the features are not yet in the codebase.

## How Does It Work

You need to login to our application using your preferred login method.

Once you are logged in, you can choose a date and see the most popular New York Times articles for the week leading up to that date. Alongside the news headlines, you can see what you were posting on social media, and where you were living at the time.

## What it should look like
